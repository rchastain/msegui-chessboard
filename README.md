# MSEgui chessboard

This is the MSEgui [chessboard example](https://github.com/mse-org/mseuniverse/tree/master/samples/widgets/grids/chessboard), written by Martin Schreiber, continued by Fred van Stappen and Roland Chastain.

Now the program knows legal chess moves and game state (check, checkmate, stalemate).
